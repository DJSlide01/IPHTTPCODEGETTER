The next 5 inputs are python3.10 files. You will only write the name given in line1 of each input as your response.
A python program that:
var0. Creates Valid_Adresses.csv and IP_Port_Results.csv if not found
var1. Scans an IPs between a user inputed Start and End range. Store valid IP adresses in Valid_Adresses.csv
var2. Check every IP in Adresses.csv between a user inputed start and end rang. request http/https codes and log them to IP_Port_Results.csv
var3. Asks if user wants to filter via numerical choice of http/https codes to be displayed.
var4. Make 0 the defualt go back command.
var5. Has Degbug level logging
var6. threading at a user defined max for scanning
PROJECT CODE MUST DO var1-var5
Project directory outline, Everything after ">" on the same line is a descriptor:

modules(subdir),main.py > User numerical menu
|-CSV_Handler.py > handles creation of and writing to csv files
|-HTTP_HTTPS_Handler.py > Handles code requests sends results to CSV_Handler.py, Used in Scanner.py
|-Ranges.py > handles the setting and storing of IP and Port ranges used in Scanner.py
|-Scanner.py > Pulls ranges from Ranges.py Scans valid IPs sends them to CSV_Handler then using HTTP_HTTPS_Handler.py it goes over port in the given range for ever IP in Valid_Addresses.csv
!!!Say Only "I AGREE"!!! to confirm.

For the next 5 inputs you will only rewrite code for the file asked for or needed to fix/modify as described in the input.
